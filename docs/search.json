And for this reason, my first redesign of the visualization was a straightforward bar chart which depicts the furlough rates of each federal department:\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows that furloughs aren’t uniformly distributed across federal departments. The departments which were civil-service heavy or generally had non-essential functions, like the National Science foundation, environmental protection agency, and NASA, had the highest furlough rates (well above 70%). On the other hand, departments considered essential, like homeland security, department of justice, and the department of transportation, were least effected with the lowest furlough rates. This difference in priority shown within the visualization challenges the idea of almost all government jobs having high security."

The perspective shifts from “how badly each department was effected” to a full department approach to the government shutdown. Though many employees from the non-essential departments were on furlough, they still maintained their status of hired until the shutdown ended and were not to work during this time. The prioritized departments like homeland security, justice, etc, were to continue their operations with or without pay until the shutdown ended. Seeing the high percentages of employees working through the shutdown offers a new perspective on the roles of certain government employees and their commitment during times of uncertainty."

Typically requiring a violator to appear in court or pay a fine.\nWarning - When a violation, typically minor, has been made but an officer issues a warning rather than a citation.\n\nThe data sets included between 24 and 34 variables, but some of many of the variables were redundant or were not applicable to the research (e.g. web_address, phone_number, name).

    "text": "Research & Analysis\n\nQuestion 1: Is there an association between gender and warnings?\nTo address this question the null and alternative hypothesis are established.\nNull Hypothesis: There is no association between gender and violation outcome, warning or citation. This would mean that the likelihood of a violator getting a warning is independent of gender.\nAlternative Hypothesis: There is an association between gender and violation outcome. This implies that gender affects the outcome of whether a violator is given a citation or warning.\nAccording to the cleaned and combined dataset for warnings and citation, there was a total of 88,320 records. By looking at the counts for each outcome (citation or warning), there are a lot more citations than there are warnings given out by FCPD. This stacked bar chart also shows that males have a higher count for both categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the warning rate for gender is calculated. This looks at the probability of a male or female violator receiving a Warning instead of a citation e.g. getting out of a ticket. To calculate warning rate, the number of warnings are divided by the total number of incidents. \\[\n\\frac{\\text{Number of Warnings}}{\\text{Total Incidents (Warnings + Citations)}}\n\\]\nThis shows a slight difference in proportion between the two genders, with females having a higher warning rate than males. In other words, females received more warnings than males. Is this difference significant or is it a result of chance or other factors? To help understand these results, the Chi-Square Test of Independence is used. The Chi-Square Test of Independence will help determine whether the variables, gender and outcome, are independent or if there is a relationship between them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\chi^2 = \\sum \\frac{(O-E)^2}{E}\n\\] To implement the Chi-Square Test, a contingency table is generated, which shows the distribution for gender and outcome.\n\n\n\nGender\nCitations\nWarnings\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n20,478\n8,777\n\n\nMale\n43,657\n15,408\n\n\n\nThe results of the Chi-Square test shows:\n\nChi-Square Statistic (x-squared): The chi-square test statistic is 150.62. This is the discrepancy between the observed frequencies, citations and warnings, and the expected frequencies if there were no association between the gender and outcome. This is demonstrated in the below tables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender\nExpected Citations\nObserved Citations\nExpected Warnings\nObserved Warnings\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n21,243\n20,478\n8,011\n8,777\n\n\nMale\n42,891\n43,657\n16,173\n15,408\n\n\n\n\nDegrees of Freedom (df): The degree of freedom for this test is 1, which is the number of rows minus 1 multiplied by number of columns minus 1.\np-value: The p-value is 2.2e-16 which is much smaller than 0.05. This represents the probability of observing the chi-square statistic, 150.62, or more if the null hypothesis were true.\n\nTo visualize each value in the above table by its contribution to the chi-square test a heatmap is generated. This quickly shows which values have the highest contribution percentage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThus the null hypothesis is rejected. The results show that there is a statistically significant association between gender and violation outcome in Fairfax County. In other words, the Chi-square test indicates that the likelihood of a violation outcome is significantly associated with gender.\n\n\nAnother Questions….\nTo address each of these question, first exploratory analysis should be done to gain an understanding and summary of the crime metrics for Fairfax County. This includes understanding what type of crimes occurred the most and where.\nGeneral crime Mapping the arrest data for a geospatial visual of where arrest occur.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext we look at the Top 10 Arrest Type by Incident Based Reporting (IBR) codes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext examining the Top 10 Citations\nWarning Versus Citation Next an examination of warning versus citation will be observed… This will help understand what different factors could play into getting a warning or a citation.\n\n\nQuestion 2: …\n…\n\n\nQuestion 3: How do enforcement outcomes vary across districts and demographic groups?\nFinally, we’ll be exploring the relationships between the outcomes of crime incidents and their district and demographic (gender, race, ethnicity) variables. Addressing this final question involved combining the three data sets of different crime outcomes: arrest data, citation data, and warning data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStarting with the outcomes across different districts, we start off by performing a chi-square test to establish whether there’s a relationship between the crime outcomes and the districts they took place in.\nNull Hypothesis: Enforcement outcome is independent of police district.\nAlternative hypothesis: Enforcement outcome and police district are associated.\nFor the chi-square implementation, a contingency table for the district and outcome counts is generated:\n\n\n              \n               Arrest Citation Warning\n  BRADDOCK       1221     7647    2645\n  DRANESVILLE     881     5055    2088\n  FRANCONIA      6011     6534    3499\n  HUNTER MILL    2001     6244    2474\n  MASON          5833     5490    2678\n  MOUNT VERNON   3040     3662    2451\n  PROVIDENCE     9315     4772    1941\n  SPRINGFIELD    1176     9909    2672\n  SULLY          2300    14854    3758\n  Unverified      356     1127     154\n\n\nFrom both the visualization above and the table output, we can see that citations are the most common outcome among the districts. However, this won’t affect the test as chi-square allows unequal margin totals. The other outcomes, arrests and warnings, vary substantially in volume across districts. Some districts (like Sully, Springfield, Providence) show particularly high citation counts, while others (Braddock, Dranesville) show lower overall enforcement volumes.\nThen the test is performed:\n\n\n\n    Pearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(combined_data$District, combined_data$Outcome)\nX-squared = 20692, df = 18, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16\n\n\nThe chi-square statistic is extremely large, which indicates a substantial deviation between observed and expected counts. The p-value is also low enough that we reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, there is a statistically significant association between district and enforcement outcome.\nFrom this, we can see that enforcement severity varies by district and district-level patterns justify further modeling.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# weights:  69 (44 variable)\ninitial  value 133797.793412 \niter  10 value 110273.346261\niter  20 value 109828.994978\niter  30 value 108047.740898\niter  40 value 106985.637011\niter  50 value 106983.922418\nfinal  value 106983.911647 \nconverged\n\n\nCall:\nmultinom(formula = Outcome ~ Race + Gender + District + Ethnicity, \n    data = combined_data)\n\nCoefficients:\n         (Intercept)     RaceB    RaceI    RaceU      RaceW    GenderM\nCitation    6.446043 -1.270532 1.902943 2.020289 -0.1401901 -0.5121848\nWarning    -2.979146 -1.162020 1.981047 1.571784 -0.0923412 -0.6626383\n           GenderO  GenderU  GenderX DistrictDRANESVILLE DistrictFRANCONIA\nCitation  6.010004 7.558657 9.927126          -0.0666923         -1.475278\nWarning  -4.276199 9.096641 8.356495           0.1233499         -1.022930\n         DistrictHUNTER MILL DistrictMASON DistrictMOUNT VERNON\nCitation          -0.6712792     -1.629807           -1.3727811\nWarning           -0.5462693     -1.210128           -0.7197438\n         DistrictPROVIDENCE DistrictSPRINGFIELD DistrictSULLY\nCitation          -2.389145           0.3690253     0.1267567\nWarning           -2.237610           0.1084139    -0.1961090\n         DistrictUnverified EthnicityB EthnicityH EthnicityN EthnicityU\nCitation         -0.7239367   2.511770  -4.582736  -3.813774  -2.729531\nWarning          -1.6738146  -2.361734   3.525458   4.685802   5.843154\n\nStd.

Certain districts, such as Providence and Sully, have higher relative odds of arrest compared to citations or warnings. Race and ethnicity are also significant predictors: Black and Hispanic individuals are more likely to be arrested rather than receive less severe enforcement actions. Gender has smaller but detectable effects. These results indicate that enforcement outcomes are influenced by both location and demographic characteristics."
