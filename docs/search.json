    "text": "Redesign 1: Bar Chart of Furlough Percentage Rates among Federal Departments\nWhen previously mention the message was over-complexly represented by the original design, I was referring to the furlough rates. And for this reason, my first redesign of the visualization was a straightforward bar chart which depicts the furlough rates of each federal department:\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis chart shows that furloughs aren’t uniformly distributed across federal departments. The departments which were civil-service heavy or generally had non-essential functions, like the National Science foundation, environmental protection agency, and NASA, had the highest furlough rates (well above 70%). On the other hand, departments considered essential, like homeland security, department of justice, and the department of transportation, were least effected with the lowest furlough rates. This difference in priority shown within the visualization challenges the idea of almost all government jobs having high security."

The values weren’t explicitly displayed in the originals, so I derived them using the given furloughed percentages when extracting the data.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncluding the working employees percentage adds another scope of analysis for the furloughing situation. The perspective shifts from “how badly each department was effected” to a full department approach to the government shutdown. Though many employees from the non-essential departments were on furlough, they still maintained their status of hired until the shutdown ended and were not to work during this time. The prioritized departments like homeland security, justice, etc, were to continue their operations with or without pay until the shutdown ended. Seeing the high percentages of employees working through the shutdown offers a new perspective on the roles of certain government employees and their commitment during times of uncertainty."
